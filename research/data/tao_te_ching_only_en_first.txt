Chapter 1

The Dao that can be stated, is not the eternal Dao;

The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

The unnamed is the origin of heaven and earth;

The named is the mother of the myriad things.

Therefore,

Constantly having no desire in order to view its commencement;

Constantly having desire in order to view its termination.

These two have the same origin, but they differ in name;

Both are called Mystery.

Mystery after Mystery, is the gate to all wonders.
